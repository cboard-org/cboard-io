**New Cboard feature!**

We got a few comments from Cboard users regarding language options on the platform. Some users had trouble understanding certain language options because of specific accents in the languages we have available. Based on this feedback, we have added more language options to Cboard. 

In order to access more language options, go into Settings, then Language, and at the bottom of the list of languages that appear, a MORE LANGUAGES symbol will appear. See below: 


We will be posting about new features added to Cboard soon. Get in touch if you have questions or comments! Your feedback helps us adapt the app to suit the users.
