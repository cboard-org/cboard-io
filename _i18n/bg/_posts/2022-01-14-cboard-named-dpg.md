On January 14, 2021, Cboard was added to the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/). The goal of the DPGA and it’s registry is to promote digital public goods in order to create a more equitable world. Being recognized as a DPG increases the visibility, support for, and prominence of open projects that have the potential to tackle global challenges. To become a digital public good, all projects are required to meet the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) to ensure that projects truly encapsulate open source principles. 

Cboard seeks to provide an accessible open-source Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app for everyone. Cboard strives to be an inclusive platform, works in over 40 languages, and has collaborators worldwide contributing to this project. Cboard is more than an app, it is a community.

For us, being recognized as a digital public good - defined as open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the SDGs - means we are achieving our mission of adhering to the highest standards of inclusivity and sustainability. 

For any inquiries on Cboard please reach out to Katrina Cohen Cosentino at [support@cboard.io](mailto:support@cboard.io). For more information on the Digital Public Goods Alliance please reach out to [hello@digitalpublicgoods.net](mailto:hello@digitalpublicgoods.net). 

The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative endorsed by the United Nations Secretary-General, working to accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.

**Our most sincere thank you from the Cboard team to everyone who has made this possible.**
