Cboard is being used as part of an initiative entitled ‘For Every Child a Voice’ implemented through the support of the *UNICEF Regional Office in Geneva and the UNICEF office in Montenegro*, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and the Bureau of Education Services. **Tamara Milic** from the Ministry of Education in Montenegro said that children have responded very well to Cboard, highlighting the app as a great tool for families and  parents, providing great support to help their children develop their vocabulary.

On July 30th, the Montenegro UNICEF regional office published a [report documenting the impact Cboard](https://www.unicef.org/montenegro/en/stories/c-board-application-makes-communication-easier-children-disabilities) has had one of the children involved in user testing, particularly as COVID-19 began to spread and inhibited children from attending school and therapy.

> CETINJE, 1 JULY 2020 – Before the coronavirus outbreak, Bojana would regularly go to "Zagorka Ivanović" kindergarten in Cetinje, as well as to the Resource Centre in Podgorica. During the COVID-19 pandemic, that was no longer possible. That is when the C-Board application became an indispensable part of the daily life of this family.

Bojana’s mother, Vjera, was interviewed and asked about their experience with the app, to which she answered:
> *We are very satisfied with the Cboard application because it has made our work and learning easier. Bojana reacted positively to the tablet, and she is more interested in this method of learning because everything shown to her is illustrated. Now everything is much more interesting to her.*

Vjera then explained what concrete progress Bojana has made while using Cboard:

> *Bojana is now able to pronounce words more easily and makes her requests with understanding. With the help of the tablet, she learned to ask for soap, toilet paper, or a towel when she goes to the bathroom. The application helped us a lot because it facilitates much better communication. At the same time,  the bonds between the members of the whole family appear to be stronger.*

A special **thank you** to everyone who has helped with this initiative at UNICEF and particularly at the Montenegro regional office.
