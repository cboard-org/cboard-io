Cboard recently concluded a four-month pilot in Timor Leste, in collaboration with UNICEF Timor Leste and Microsoft.

The pilot, spanning from September to December 2023, employed the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) methodology to assess its impact. Participants completed PIADS forms in September before using Cboard and again after 2-3 months of active engagement. A mid-pilot in-person evaluation occurred in October, featuring observations within the participating schools. The pilot involved three schools, one in Dili and two in the municipality of Baucau, with PicSeePal generously donating 60 devices to support the schools in Baucau lacking tablets and internet access.
